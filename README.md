This is where I got my prompt Enter method from^

This is a RPG game I made from scratch. I thought about how an RPG would based on my knowledge in Java and from playing them for most my life, and attempted to code it accordingly. I only looked up syntax and aspects like how to incorporate random numbers or certain placement of the while loops, usually using java documentation to assist. The story is 100% original. I thought it would be fun to learn programming through the creation of a turn based battle game with a unique story. There is still more to add and to learn from, so this game is in its Beta stage but runs just fine.

Hope you enjoy playing
